Binary Search Trees
-------------------

Types of Traversals
Inorder (LNR) decending to ascending (infix)
Preorder (NLR) order of the tree (preorder)
Postorder (LRN) (postfix)

Evaluate from the bottom up

Height is max level

We indicate what subtree that we want by using some variation of LNR
Left Node Right
Do this recursively


Needed Stuff
Traversals - recursion
NodeCount - recursion
Height - recursion
LeafNodesCount - recursion
